# EBIO 338/538 Class 05 R Base Graphics


#1a Load the Daphnia data from Class 04 and name the object daph

#b Examine the structure of daph and the first five lines

#c Plot the relationship between growth rate and pH with growth rate on the y-axis

#d Make the axes labels more attractive

#e Color code the different Clone types by adding points() for each subset in a different color. 
# Make them solid points of different shapes 

#f Add a main label to the graph describing its contents (e.g., Daphnia growth rates by clone type relative to pH)

#g Add three rows of text in the upper left corner of the plot where 
# each line specifies a Clone type (e.g., Clone1) in its respective color

#h Now repeat this figure 3 times within a multi-panel layout that has 1 row and 3 columns.
# Use different color schemes and point shapes in each iteration
